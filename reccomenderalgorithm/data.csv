Borgia,1168,2011,38,English,France,Story of the rise and the fall of the Renaissance dynasty.,"It was the age of Leonardo Da Vinci and Michelangelo, of enlightened creativity and unparalleled intellectual achievement. But it was also the age of Machievelli, of rampant lawlessness, incessant war, and unspeakable depravity. At the heart of the world order was the Vatican, the arbiter of conflicts between kingdoms and empires. And at the center of the Vatican was a man whose quest for power would propel him to seek the ultimate prize, the holy see of Rome. He was a man whose name would become synonymous with ruthlessness, and whose reign as Pope would be remembered as the most infamous chapter of the history of the Catholic church, Rodrigo Borgia. His four children -Juan, the oldest, a prideful, lazy, unscrupulous sexual predator, Cesare, a young man torn between a faith that was not his calling and his dark violent nature, Lucretia, a young girl discovering the secret power that a women's sexuality holds, and Goffredo, an innocent child who would come of age in a family riven by conflict, would provide Rodrigo with a challenge as great as the political maneuvering of his political and religious rivals. This show was a one hour dramatic series that chronicled the rise to power of this Spanish Cardinal and his clan, who sought to establish a dynasty that held sway over the entire world. Though a man of faith, Rodrigo was also in thrall to the pleasures of the flesh. Not only did he have to deal with the plotting and conspiracies of his fellow cardinals and the representatives of the great powers, but he was locked in a struggle to contain the bitter sibling rivalries that threatened to tear his family apart. This show was a cauldron of intrigue, violence, murder, lust, politics, faith, incest, betrayal, and redemption, a story as compelling and enlightening as the age in which it took place. —Tom Fontana",7.8,Biography.Drama.History,"['Mark Ryder', 'Isolda Dychauk', 'Diarmuid Noyes', 'John Doman', 'Marta Gastini', 'Assumpta Serna', 'Art Malik', 'Victor Schefé', 'Dejan Cukic', 'Paul Brennen', 'Scott William Winters', 'Michael Fitzgerald', 'Andrew Hawley', 'Karel Dobrý', 'Christian McKay', ""Valentina D'Agostino"", 'Alejandro Albarracín', 'Stanley Weber']",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ0OGE4NGItOGI1NS00N2FiLWExZTQtYmJjNjFmZmNkYTQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTQxNzM2MjY@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg,tt1736341

Jeremy, who is in love with Aelita, struggles through season 1 to find a way to ""materialize"" Aelita, so she can become human by exiting the scanners that connect Odd, Ulrich, and Yumi to Lyoko.

He has just returned from military service and is about to marry the girl of his dreams, the stunning Eysan. His two best friends, Cengiz and Ali are like brothers to him, and he trusts them with all his heart. Everything seems perfect, as his whole life lies in front of him. The drama starts when the police storm into Omer's bedroom when he is still sleeping. He gets arrested for a murder and robbery at the casino the night before. Omer gets imprisoned for the crime - his life is shattered, friends and fiancé disappear. Instead, one single question is on his mind for the next ten years: Why? It is obvious that Omer has been set up, but could such a terrible crime really have been planned by his two best friends and fiancé Eysan? Omer gets eventually declared dead in prison, but the death is a cover up for the revenge to come. After plastic surgery Omer returns as Ezel, with only one mission in life - to find an explanation, and to take everything away from those who once destroyed his life. But first, he has to kill the constant, incorrigible, and endless love he still carries for the girl of his dreams, Eysan. One by one, the pieces fall in place in a very thrilling story. Omer's two best friends Ali and Cengiz were convinced to rob the casino by the mafioso Serdar Tezcan , who also happens to be Omer's girlfriend Eysan's father. Serdar created the whole plan. He needed four people for a successful robbery. The first, Cengiz would be the mole who was working in the casino and who would therefore gain access. The second, Ali would be the ruthless killer who has no problem committing murder if needed. The third, Eysan would be the skilled con-woman who would manipulate the characters. Finally, Omer would be blamed for the robbery by way of implanting false evidence, and therefore misleading the police and causing them to cease all other investigations. Eysan would later testify in court in order to re-establish the evidence and accusations, thus cementing her betrayal. The plan worked successfully and while all 4 got away with millions of dollars' worth of money, Omer went to jail the day after he proposed to Eysan. In 2006, Omer, who had a full plastic surgery, and changed his name to Ezel Bayraktar (""eternity"" in Turkish), returns to get his revenge, unknown to his previous friends, Eysan and Cengiz (who are now married with a son), and Ali (who is head of security at Cengiz's hotel) The once simple boy becomes a man exceptionally skilled at gambling, reading people, fighting, and has considerably high class in society.

Jeopardy!,1208,1984,8358,English,United States,A returning champion and two challengers test their buzzer skills and their knowledge in a wide range of academic and popular categories.,"On the heels of the syndicated success of ""Wheel of Fortune (1983)"", producer Merv Griffin decided to return his classic quiz show-with-a-twist, ""Jeopardy!"" to the airwaves in 1984. It, too, was a huge success, and also marked a return to the game's tried-and-true formula of answers and questions (after a slightly-modified remake six years earlier failed to catch on). Three contestants, including a returning champion, competed. Six categories are announced (e.g., Art World, Cooking, 20th Century Republicans, ""Friends (1994)"", Muscle Men and College Girls Wearing White T-shirts), each having five answers ostensibly graded by difficulty, from $100 to $500. The champion chose a category and dollar amount (e.g., ""College Girls Wearing White T-shirts for $100""), to which host Trebek reads the answer (""Inspector 12 must give her seal of approval before a college girl can wear one of these plain white T-shirts""). Contestants had to respond in question form (""What is Hanes?"") ; if correct, they won the value of the question; if he/she was incorrect, failed to answer in time or phrase in the form of a question, that amount was deducted (hence, the dollar amount was ""always in jeopardy"") and his/her opponents could answer; having enough incorrect answers often led to negative scores. Thereafter, the contestant providing the last correct question selected next, and the process repeated; some answers made use of audio and/or video clues. Hidden behind one of the answers was a ""Daily Double"" space, with the contestant selecting that space able to wager up to all his/her current winnings or up to $500 if he/she had less) on the answer. After all 30 answers have been revealed (or sometimes, an undefined time limit expired), the game moved into ""Double Jeopardy!"" Gameplay was the same in ""Double Jeopardy!"" except six new categories were announced and the answers had values of $200 to $1,000 and two ""Daily Double"" spaces were hidden (with contestants able to wager up to $1,000 if they had less). At the end of the ""Double Jeopardy!"" round, all contestants with at least $1 were eligible to play ""Final Jeopardy!""; however, anyone with $0 or a negative score was disqualified from further play. Trebek announced a category, and the contestants (before seeing the answer) wagered up to everything they had on their ability to answer. Contestants had 30 seconds to write what they believed was the correct question. Those who were correct had the amount they wagered added to their winnings; however, any incorrect questions or failing to phrase properly lost what they wagered. The contestant with the most cash was champion, kept his/her winnings and got to return the next day. Champions competed until they won five shows (at which point they retired undefeated and, starting in 1997, also won a new car) or until they were defeated. All five-time champions and other high-scoring contestants over a period of time participated in a Tournament of Champions, the winner earning an additional $100,000; there were also teen, college, senior and international tournaments and celebrity shows conducted (the winners of the non-celebrity tournaments also earned a spot in the Tournament of Champions). In the fall of 2001, several changes were made, including the use of a ""Clue Crew"" (new regulars illustrating answers in selected categories by going ""on location""), and an increase in the dollar values of the answers (from $200 to $1,000 in Jeopardy! and $400 to $2,000 in Double Jeopardy!) ; another running change through the years was the addition of ""celebrity guests"" reading certain answers. None of the changes altered the basic game play, however. —Brian Rathjen <briguy_52732@yahoo.com>",8.2,Game-Show,"['Alex Trebek', 'Johnny Gilbert', 'Jimmy McGuire', 'Sarah Whitcomb Foss', 'Kelly Miyahara', 'Ken Jennings', 'Jon Cannon', 'Cheryl Farrell', 'Brad Rutter', 'James Holzhauer', 'Buzzy Cohen', 'Julia Collins', 'Austin Rogers', 'Mehmet Oz', 'Jason Zuffranieri', 'Alan Lin', 'Roger Craig', 'Anderson Cooper']",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjM3ZjkwNjEtNzNiOS00OThhLTkxOTQtODg3MTEyN2E1ZDgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTU2NDQ3NjU@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg,tt0159881

The safest place for them to go is San Fermin, her hometown, about an hour away from the capital, where Juana finds not only a hiding place, but also reconnects with her past. This reconnection is personified by Ambrosio, her father and the mayor of San Fermin, with whom she had broken off relations fifteen years before. Soon Juana is going to discover that San Fermin, like many other small towns in Latin America, has become a sort of backyard to the capital and home to a large, unpopular, and undesired landfill. After saving a girl from a fire and becoming an unexpected heroine, Juana will be convinced that she can give something back to the welcoming community by working with her father on the city council. After a while, Juana will uncover a dark case of political corruption that directly involves her father and the powerful company that manages the town's landfill. This will lead her to become an inexperienced but convictional mayor, who courageously faces the various injustices that the town suffers. In the midst of enormous sacrifices to her personal life and family, Juana and her loyal team fight to mobilize the people and demand that central government put a stop to corruption. This conflict is coupled by her struggle to raise her son, who becomes more and more rebellious as the story unfolds, as well as dealing with a love triangle that forms between Juana, one of the town's police officers, and a former boyfriend from her youth. —Nimrod Amitai",7,Drama,"['Elisa Zulueta', 'Lux Pascal', 'Gastón Salgado', 'Nelson Brodt', 'Daniel Guillón', 'Alejandro Trejo', 'Emilia Noguera', 'Ángela Lineros', 'Paulina Urrutia', 'Willy Semler', 'Leonardo Bertolini', 'Mateo Iribarren', 'Andrés Skoknic', 'Eyal Meyer', 'Max Corvalán', 'Estrella Ortiz', 'Luz María Yacometti', 'Jaime Beiza']",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWQwNzk4OGMtYmI4OC00ZDFmLWFkNDctZDAwMjQ4NTBkYmI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUzNTMxNDU@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg,tt5235318

When people head to Humboldt County, California in search of quick riches in the form of marijuana, often times they are unaware of the price they might ultimately pay in the illegal cannabis growing capital of the United States. The area produces at least 60% of the black market marijuana crop in the US, and also leads the state in missing persons cases. The series dives into the disappearance of one of these individuals, following the trail of 29-year-old Garret Rodriguez who goes missing on Murder Mountain. His disappearance and the events surrounding the investigation into his whereabouts threaten to expose a wild, lawless place, and will forever change the local community. The area known as Alderpoint - commonly known as Murder Mountain by residents, is not only mountainous and spacious but a surreal, little corner of America.

However, Erica comes across her best friend Sarah, and Jesse, Sarah's vampire ex-boyfriend, on the night she is to babysit, and decides to attend a party that Jesse is throwing instead.

Sarah leaves to get Erica back from the party, knowing the party is full of bloodthirsty vampires. Curious, the boys have Benny's grandmother watch over Jane while they follow Sarah. They see her feed on a rat and realize she is a vampire. Sarah quickly explains that she is only a fledgling, a vampire who has not drunk human blood. The three of them return home, where they are attacked by a vampire sent by Jesse. The vampire is subdued by Sarah and they head to the vampire party to save Erica and and their dimwitted friend, Rory. However, Erica has been bitten by Gord and later bites Rory. Ethan, Benny, and Sarah then battle the vampires and escape. The next day, Rory, now a full vampire after drinking human blood, informs Ethan and Benny that Jesse's gang are going to church so Ethan, Benny and Sarah follow them. Ethan has a vision in which he sees a gravestone, whose dates unscramble to the number 219, and a mysterious box, which is then uncovered by the vampires. The box is called the Cubile Animus or ""Nest of Souls."" Ethan and Sarah figure out Jesse's full plan from an old book, learning that in the original settlement of the town, there was a priest named Reverend Horace Black that led an evil vampire cult. The townspeople burned the cult members, leading to all ""219"" of their deaths during a lunar eclipse. In another vision, Ethan sees that Jesse is Horace Black, and plans to use the box to trap the souls of teens going to see a movie premiere to resurrect the souls of his ancient cult during the lunar eclipse occurring on that same night. Benny's grandmother, who reveals that she is an Earth Priestess, gives Ethan, Benny and Sarah enchanted daggers and a spellbook to defeat the vampires. She explains that Ethan sees visions because he is a Seer, which enables him to see visions through touch, and that Benny is a spellmaster, allowing him to cast spells. At the theater, the vampires begin to steal the souls of the teens, but are thwarted by Ethan, Benny and Sarah. Jesse escapes and Ethan and Benny follow in pursuit. In another vision, Ethan sees the tree he saw inside the old book, realizing it's the tree in his backyard, where they find Jesse. As the eclipse begins, Jesse attempts to hold Ethan and Benny down and resurrect the souls he already obtained from the Cubile Animus, but Sarah intervenes. When the box lands in Ethan's hands, he releases the vengeful souls that were captured, and they destroy Jesse.

After a traumatic time serving as a mercenary at the Silesian front, Jan deserts from the Austrian army. Destitute and exhausted, he returns home, to the Flemish region of Aalst. To his surprise, everything has changed beyond recognition. His village has been transformed into a French army encampment. His family and friends have been outlawed and banished to Kluisbossen forest. Jan joins the ramshackle gang of robbers led by his half-brother Tincke. But in a country suffering under the yoke of poverty and exploitation, there's hardly anything left worth taking. Moved by these harsh living conditions, Jan manages to convince Tincke to see the bigger picture. Instead of stealing from each other, they should rob those who actually have money: the rich and the collaborators consorting with the French occupiers. John's ideas start to resonate and when a stagecoach is raided successfully, the ragtag bunch of scallywags develops into a real gang. The decision to share their booty with the poorest of the poor makes them popular, and their motto, ""Voor gene chanterik peu""(not afraid of anyone), spreads across the land like wildfire. When the authorities catch wind of this, the ambitious city guard Baru declares war on Jan and his gang. Thanks to his dedicated police work, Baru manages to infiltrate the gang and capture John. During his captivity, John's popularity only increases. The gang is out for revenge and will do anything to liberate Jan: it's the beginning of a war that leads to outright revolution.

There is a theme to each week's competition, generally in the vein of the type of goods the competitors are to bake (i.e. cakes, cookies, pastry, etc.). Each week, they are given a set amount of time to complete each of three challenges, their finished products which are evaluated by expert judges. The first weekly challenge is the signature bake, the competitors to bake something from their home recipes which are to signify who they are as bakers within the category. The second weekly challenge is the technical challenge, where each of the competitors are provided the same recipe, in large part of something they may have never heard of let alone baked before in their lives. This challenge is to see how knowledgeable the competitors are about general baking concepts. Their finished products are evaluated blind in that the judges have no idea who baked what. The third weekly challenge is the showstopper challenge, in which the competitors are to pull out all the stops to produce a baked good which overall grand appearance is as important as taste. At the end of the week based solely on the three challenges, the judges will name the best competitor star baker, and will send one competitor home, that person whose competition has come to an end. The final three competitors enter into the finale, the winner of that week who will be crowned the overall competition winner. —Huggo",7.4,Game-Show,"['Bruno Feldeisen', 'Kyla Kennaley', 'Dan Levy', 'Julia Chan', 'Rochelle Adonis', 'Aurora Browne', 'Carolyn Taylor', 'James Hoyland', 'Vandana Jain', 'Megan Stasiewich', 'Colin Asuncion', 'Alan Shane Lewis', 'Ann Pornel', 'Sabrina Degni', 'Linda Longson', 'Timothy Fu', 'Mengling Chen', 'Andrei Godoroja']",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjc2MDUwMWYtYjM0Zi00MzExLTlmYjktZGRlOWY4Zjc2ZGM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTEwMTQ0Njk3._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg,tt7332358

Wentworth,354,2013,100,English,Australia,Bea Smith is locked up while awaiting trial for the attempted murder of her husband and must learn how life works in prison.,"Fans of the iconic Prisoner Cell Block H series, which pushed boundaries over three decades ago and still boasts a loyal following worldwide today, will remember Bea Smith as gutsy and fearless, ruling Wentworth Correctional Centre with an iron fist. But who was Bea Smith before prison? How did a wife and mother from the suburbs become a top dog without rival? Wentworth Prison is a dynamic, often confronting, drama series that begins with Bea's early days in prison. Set in the present day, it is a modern adaptation of Prisoner Cell Block H that contemporises legendary characters and their stories for today's audience. This series takes the viewer inside to an uncompromising environment that explores the politics of women in a world without men, and how such a threatening experience both challenges and often changes those confined and working behind the razor wire. The audience will be introduced to Bea all over again and meet her allies and enemies in the form of iconic inmates: Doreen Anderson, Liz Birdsworth and Franky Doyle, and there are new faces such as Jacs Holt, the ruthless matriarch of a crime family who now reigns over Wentworth. Favourite offices will also return. Meg Jackson carries a shameful secret; Vera Bennett, the well-meaning officer who discovers everyone has a price; Erica Davidson, the crusading Lawyer and Matthew Fletcher who believes in retribution rather than rehabilitation. And a new face, Meg's husband Will Jackson, whose past still haunts him. Each episode explores an individual character's back story, providing an insight to what makes them tick and the circumstances that led them to Wentworth. In doing so we discover that the difference between an inmate and an officer is sometimes simply geography, because they're all prisoners in surprisingly different ways. Like the original Prisoner Cell Block H, Wentworth Prison is, at its heart, a series about survival, a character drama featuring women living in a pressure cooker environment. Despite the rivalries and power struggles, this family of misfits and rebels are forced to forge unlikely friendships and allegiances if they want to survive their time inside. —ahmetkozan",8.6,Crime.Drama,"['Kate Atkinson', 'Katrina Milosevic', 'Robbie Magasiva', 'Jacqueline Brennan', 'Celia Ireland', 'Pamela Rabe', 'Kate Jenkinson', 'Bernard Curry', 'Lauri McLennan', 'Nicole da Silva', 'Lucia Brancatisano', 'Shareena Clanton', 'Eloise Wright', 'Danielle Cormack', 'Tammy Macintosh', 'Rarriwuy Hick', 'Susie Porter', 'Katherine Grinlaw']",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDkxZmFhMDAtMmIyZS00NjAwLThlYjctZDQwMWQwYzdlYWY4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTE1NjY5Mg@@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg,tt2433738
